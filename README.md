# Deepfake Detection with Meso4 Model

This repository contains a PyTorch Lightning implementation of the Meso4 model for deepfake detection. The model is trained to distinguish between real and deepfake images.

## Files
- `data.py`: Contains data loading and transformation logic.
- `model.py`: Contains the Meso4 model definition.
- `train.py`: Script for training the model.
- `inference.py`: Script for running inference on new data.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
